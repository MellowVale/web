    <p>The limitations set forth in this section will not limit or exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud or
        intentional misconduct of Mellow Vale or the other Mellow Vale Parties or for any other matters in which
        liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the
        exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not
        apply to you.</p>
    <h2 id="section-12-release">12. Release</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release Mellow Vale and the other Mellow Vale Parties
        from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and
        nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to
        disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. <span class="strong">You expressly waive any
            rights you may have under California Civil Code &sect; 1542 as well as any other statute or common law
            principles that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you
            may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.</span></p>
    <h2 id="section-13-transfer-and-processing-data">13. Transfer and Processing Data</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using our Services, you acknowledge and, as applicable, consent to the processing, transfer and
        storage of information about you in and to the United States and other countries.</p>
    <h2 id="section-14-dispute-resolution-binding-arbitration-agreement">14. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration Agreement</h2>
    <p class="strong">Please read the following section carefully because it requires users who are U.S. residents to
        arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Mellow Vale and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from
        us.</p>
    <p><span class="underline">Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</span> Except for small claims disputes in which
        you or Mellow Vale seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your
        billing address or disputes in which you or Mellow Vale seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the
        alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Mellow Vale waive your rights to a jury trial and to
        have any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or our Services resolved in court. This Arbitration
        Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were
        asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.</p>
    <p><span class="underline">Arbitration Rules and Forum.</span> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the
        interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send
        a written notice requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to
        <a href="mailto:support@mellowvale.com">support@mellowvale.com</a>. The arbitration will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration by the Judicial Arbitration and
        Mediation Services (&ldquo;JAMS&rdquo;), an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes
        involving claims, counterclaims, or requests for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys&rsquo; fees
        and interest, shall be subject to JAMS&rsquo;s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
        procedures available; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS&rsquo;s most current version of the
        Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at <a
            href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>.
        JAMS&rsquo;s rules are also available at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling
        JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral
        forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS&rsquo;s filing, administrative, hearing and/or
        other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Mellow Vale will pay them for you. In addition, we will
        reimburse all such JAMS&rsquo;s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or
        requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You
        may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the
        country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
        arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
    <p><span class="underline">Authority of Arbitrator.</span> The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a)
        determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the
        interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including, but not
        limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The
        arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Mellow Vale. The arbitration proceeding
        will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall
        have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the
        authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
        under applicable law, the arbitral forum&rsquo;s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).
        The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and
        conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has
        the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award
        of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p>
    <p><span class="underline">Waiver of Jury Trial.</span> YOU AND MELLOW VALE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND
        STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Mellow Vale are
        instead electing that all disputes, claims or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this
        Arbitration Agreement, except as specified above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same
        damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or
        jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p>
    <p><span class="underline">Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.</span> ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS AND
        REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND
        NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT
        BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law
        precludes enforcement of any of this subsection&rsquo;s limitations as to a given dispute, claim or request for
        relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts
        located in the State of California. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.</p>
    <p><span class="underline">30-Day Right to Opt-Out.</span> You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this
        Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to <a
            href="mailto:support@mellowvale.com">support@mellowvale.com</a>,
        within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration
        Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your username (if any), the e-mail address you used
        to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this
        Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will
        continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration
        agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p>
    <p>You and Mellow Vale agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States
        sitting in Santa Clara County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an
        arbitration award.</p>
    <p><span class="underline">Severability.</span> Except as provided in this Section 14 above, if any part or parts of
        this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or
        parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall
        continue in full force and effect.</p>
    <p><span class="underline">Survival of Agreement.</span> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of
        your relationship with Mellow Vale.</p>
    <p><span class="underline">Modification.</span> Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we
        agree that if Mellow Vale makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that
        change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing to <a
            href="mailto:support@mellowvale.com">support@mellowvale.com</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="section-15-governing-law-and-venue">15. Governing Law and Venue</h2>
    <p>This Agreement and your access to and use of our Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in
        accordance with the laws of California, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without regard to conflict
        of law rules or principles (whether of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
        the laws of any other jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not
        apply to the Agreement. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in
        small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States,
        respectively, sitting in Santa Clara County, California.</p>
    <h2 id="section-16-electronic-communications">16. Electronic Communications</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using the Services, you also consent to receive electronic communications from Mellow Vale
        (e.g., responses to your requests, questions and feedback, announcements, updates, and security alerts through a
        push notification or by posting notices on our Services). You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or
        other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements,
        including, but not limited to, that such communications be in writing.</p>
    <h2 id="section-17-termination">17. Termination</h2>

        Services. We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our Services.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-18-severability">18. Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision or part of a provision of this Agreement is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or
        part of the provision is deemed severable from this Agreement and does not affect the validity and
        enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>

        store provider (e.g., the Apple App Store or Google Play), not by Mellow Vale. Pricing, billing terms, and
        renewal options are presented at the time of purchase and are governed by the app store&rsquo;s terms and your
        account settings.</p>
    <p><span class="strong">Auto-renewal and cancellation.</span> Unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of
        the current billing period, subscriptions will renew automatically and your account will be charged. You can
        manage or cancel subscriptions in your app store account settings. Deleting the app does not cancel your
        subscription.</p>
    <p><span class="strong">Trials and refunds.</span> If you start a free trial, you will be charged when the trial
        ends unless you cancel before the trial period ends. Payments are non-refundable and there are no refunds or

        entire agreement between you and Mellow Vale relating to your access to and use of our Services. The failure
        of Mellow Vale to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of

        contractual effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement is intended solely for the benefit of
        the parties and is not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.</p>
